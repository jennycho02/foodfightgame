Food Fight! is an original game where players try to put their opponent into a food coma by hitting them with the most food elements.

Each player has a fullness bar which tracks their total fullness.

If a player's fullness bar reaches maz capacity they will lose.

Players can gain an advantage by catching a rainbow apple and becoming a chef. The golden apple will give the player one of three available powerups, "speed", "food basket", or a "super sizer".
* Speedy Sundae: Move twice as fast as your opponent to quickly navigate the screen, pick up fruit, and shoot at opponent
* Food Basket: Throw fruit without having to pick up items
* Super Sizer: Food items are 2x as large!

## Future Work 
We'd like to improve this game with some future improvements. We have enumerated some suggestions below.
 ### Graphics
 * Changes in graphics to be more like cafeteria
 * Better animated arm and leg movements to show movement
 * Food animations to show hits

 ### Game Play
 * More power ups
 * Levels to choose from
 * Power meter so players can choose how far to throw
 * Obstacles (ex shelves on the wall that food will collide with)
 * Accuracy meter
